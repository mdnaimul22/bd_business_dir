# User Guide

This guide explains how to use the BD Business Directory application.

## Searching for Businesses

1.  **Home Page**: Navigate to the home page (`/`).
2.  **Search Bar**: Use the search input to type keywords.
3.  **Filters**: You can refine your search by selecting a specific 'Area' or 'Category' from the dropdown menus if available.
4.  **Submit**: Press the 'Search' button.
5.  **Results**: A list of matching shops will appear. Click on a shop name or 'View Details' to see more information.

## Viewing Shop Details

- From the search results or the 'All Shops' list, click on a shop.
- The details page displays:
    - Shop Name
    - Owner Name
    - Contact Numbers (clickable on mobile)
    - Address
    - Email/Website (clickable links)
    - Category

## Managing Categories

- Use the sidebar (toggleable) to view existing categories.
- Click "Add New Category" to create a new business classification.
- Enter the category name and save.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Errors**: If the app fails to load data, ensure `shop_details.db` exists in the root directory and has read/write permissions.
- **Image Issues**: If screenshots don't load in the README, ensure the `docs/images` folder is intact.
